BeltUpgrader notes:
	- Consider using splitter's related_underground_belt field to add to the upgrade list.
		- Default behaviour:
			- Splitter terminates, not inclusive.
			- Alternate behaviour (as per user setting, maybe), splitter terminates, inclusive.
			- Second key force upgrades entire line, splitters not terminating -- check if possible?
	- Kyk na downgrade opsies
		- Is daar 'n "previous_upgrade" property?
	- Kyk na toolbar button, etc., soos upgrade of blueprint planner
		- Left click is default behaviour, shift+leftclick is downstream, ctrl+shift+leftclick is upstream, ctrl=shift+alt+leftclick is force upgrade die hele lyn.
		- Right click is default behaviour maar vir downgrades, shift+rightclick is downstream, ctrl+shift+rightclick is upstream, ctrl=shift+alt+rightclick is force downgrade die hele lyn.
	- Is daar 'n "direction" per belt entity? 
		- As ja, indien output meer as 1 input het, volg net as die input dieselfde rigting as die output is.
		- As initial meer as 1 input het, volg net die input wat dieselfde rigting het as die initial.
