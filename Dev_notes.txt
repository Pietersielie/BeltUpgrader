BeltUpgrader notes:
	- Consider using splitter's related_underground_belt field to add to the upgrade list.
		- Default behaviour:
			- Splitter terminates, not inclusive.
			- Alternate behaviour (as per user setting, maybe), splitter terminates, inclusive.
			- Second key force upgrades entire line, splitters not terminating -- check if possible?
